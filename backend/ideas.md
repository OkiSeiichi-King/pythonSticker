_Please jot down your thought process here._

1)At first, I placed the stickers without an algorithm and then got the result of the current state.
But there was a problem that the stickers are much bigger than peerbook.
So I changed the resolution of my screen and I got the result I wished.

2)I got attention from the functions you pointed out that I must use.

3)So I thought that I should get angle and positoin by moving the stickers in certain range and calculating the overlay of stickers.
So I found the possible the certain range of each sticker.

That's all.
Thanks.
